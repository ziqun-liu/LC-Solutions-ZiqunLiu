# LRU Cache Interview Questions

## Basic Understanding
1. **What is an LRU Cache?**
   - Explain the concept of Least Recently Used (LRU) and how it helps manage a fixed-size cache.
   An LRU Cache, or Least Recently Used Cache, is a data structure used to store a fixed number of items, where the least recently used item is removed when the cache reaches its capacity and a new item needs to be added.

2. **Why do we use an LRU Cache?**
   - Discuss use cases like memory management, page replacement algorithms, or database caching.

3. **What are the time complexity and space complexity requirements for an optimal LRU Cache?**
   - Expected: \( O(1) \) for both `get` and `put`, with \( O(capacity) \) space complexity.

## Design Questions
4. **How would you implement an LRU Cache?**
   - Discuss the combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map, emphasizing why this combination is efficient.

5. **Why is a doubly linked list used in LRU Cache implementation?**
   - Explain how it allows efficient removal and insertion of nodes.

6. **What are the alternatives to a doubly linked list for implementing an LRU Cache?**
   - Compare to alternatives like a single linked list, priority queue, or circular buffer.

7. **What happens if the cache size is 1?**
   - Discuss edge cases and how your implementation handles them.

8. **How would you handle frequent updates to the cache?**
   - Explore scenarios where `put` or `get` operations occur at high frequency and discuss the potential bottlenecks.

## Code Analysis
9. **Walk me through the code for your LRU Cache implementation.**
   - Explain each function (`get`, `put`, `remove`, `insert`) and the role of sentinel nodes if used.

10. **What are the potential pitfalls in your implementation?**
    - Discuss issues like memory leaks, incorrect pointer management, or edge cases.

11. **How would you test your LRU Cache implementation?**
    - Suggest test cases:
      - Basic functionality (e.g., adding and accessing keys).
      - Evicting the least recently used item.
      - Handling duplicate `put` calls.
      - Handling edge cases like capacity = 0 or 1.

12. **How does your implementation handle concurrent access?**
    - Discuss thread safety and what changes would be needed for a multithreaded environment.

---

## Optimization and Trade-offs
13. **How would you optimize your implementation for very large capacity?**
    - Discuss memory overhead and whether additional optimizations are needed for a very high number of entries.

14. **What trade-offs are involved in your design?**
    - Compare time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity.

15. **Could you modify your design to allow customization, such as replacing LRU with LFU (Least Frequently Used)?**
    - Discuss the flexibility of the current design and what changes would be required.

---

## Behavioral and Problem-solving
16. **What challenges did you face while implementing an LRU Cache?**
    - Share a specific problem you encountered and how you solved it.

17. **If you encountered a bug in your implementation during testing, how would you debug it?**
    - Discuss debugging strategies for pointer errors or hash map issues.

18. **How would you handle capacity resizing for an LRU Cache (e.g., increasing or decreasing the capacity dynamically)?**
    - Explore design changes to accommodate dynamic resizing.

---

## Advanced Variants
19. **How would you implement an LRU Cache in a distributed system?**
    - Discuss how to handle consistency, replication, and eviction policies across nodes.

20. **How can you make an LRU Cache persistent (e.g., saving its state to disk)?**
    - Explore serialization or using a database for persistent storage.

21. **What happens if the hash map implementation has a lot of hash collisions?**
    - Analyze the performance impact and discuss how to mitigate it.

22. **Can you design an LRU Cache where `get` is \( O(1) \) but `put` is \( O(\log N) \)?**
    - Propose alternatives like using a binary search tree or a priority queue for the eviction policy.

---

## Hands-on Coding Challenges
23. **Write code to extend the LRU Cache to store additional metadata with each entry.**
    - Example: Add a timestamp for each entry or track how many times a key has been accessed.

24. **Modify your LRU Cache to return the most frequently accessed item in \( O(1) \).**
    - Combine LRU and LFU policies and handle corner cases.

25. **Implement a simpler version of an LRU Cache using just an array or linked list.**
    - Discuss the inefficiencies and compare with the doubly linked list + hash map approach.
