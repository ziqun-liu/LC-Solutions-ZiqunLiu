# Merge k Sorted Lists: Interview Questions

## **Algorithm and Complexity**
### **Basic Understanding**
1. How does your solution handle merging multiple lists efficiently?
	- the solution uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It merges pairs of lists iteratively, 
	  reducing the number of lists by half in each round until only one list remains. 
	  This minimizes redundant comparisons
2. What is the time complexity of your solution?
3. What is the space complexity of your solution, and why?

### **Optimization**
4. Can you optimize your solution further?
5. What are the trade-offs between using a divide-and-conquer approach versus a priority queue (min-heap) approach?

## **Design and Implementation**
### **Implementation Details**
6. How does your function handle edge cases, like when all lists are empty or when only one list is provided?
7. How does your solution ensure stability (relative order of equal elements)?
8. Explain the role of the `dummy` node in the merging process.

### **Alternate Approaches**
9. Can you solve this problem using a priority queue (min-heap)? What would be the time and space complexity of that approach?
10. Could you write a brute-force solution and explain why it is inefficient for larger inputs?

## **Linked List Operations**
### **Linked List Concepts**
11. How would you merge two sorted linked lists? Can you write the function separately?
12. What are the advantages of using linked lists versus arrays in this problem?

---

## **Edge Cases and Debugging**
### **Edge Cases**
13. What happens if one of the lists is `null` or empty?
14. How does your solution handle very large \( k \) (number of lists) or very large \( N \) (total number of nodes)?

### **Debugging**
15. If your code doesn¡¯t work, how would you debug it?
16. How would you test your solution for correctness and performance?

## **Advanced Questions**
### **Parallel Processing**
17. Can this problem be solved in parallel? If so, how would you divide the work?
18. How would the implementation change if the lists were distributed across multiple servers?

### **Comparison of Techniques**
19. Compare the divide-and-conquer approach with the heap-based approach in terms of implementation complexity and runtime performance.
20. In what situations would you prefer one approach over the other?

---

## **Follow-Up Variations**
### **Variations of the Problem**
21. How would your solution change if the input were an array of arrays instead of linked lists?
22. What if the input lists were unsorted? How would you approach the problem then?
23. Can you merge \( k \) sorted arrays instead of linked lists efficiently?

### **Dynamic Input**
24. What if new lists are added dynamically after the initial merge process has started? How would you handle it?

## **Behavior and Interview Soft Skills**
### **Behavioral Questions**
25. How did you approach solving the problem initially?
26. Why did you choose this method over others?
27. If you were given unlimited time, how would you further refine your solution?
