# LRU Cache Interview Questions

## Basic Understanding
1. **What is an LRU Cache?** \
Explain the concept of Least Recently Used (LRU) and how it helps manage a fixed-size cache.
   - An LRU Cache, or Least Recently Used Cache, is a data structure used to store a fixed number of items, where the least recently used item is removed when the cache reaches its capacity and a new item needs to be added.
     It works by keeping track of the order in which items are accessed or used. When an item is accessed, it is marked as the most recently used. This ensures that items that are frequently accessed stay in the cache, while items that are less frequently used are removed to make space for new data.
   - A common way to implement an LRU Cache is by using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list:\
     -The hash map provides 𝑂(1) access to cache items by key.\
     -The doubly linked list maintains the order of usage, allowing 𝑂(1)insertion and removal of items from the least or most recently used positions.

2. **Why do we use an LRU Cache?**
Discuss use cases like memory management, page replacement algorithms, or database caching.
   - An LRU Cache is used to efficiently manage limited memory by keeping only the most recently accessed data and discarding the least recently used items. This improves performance in scenarios like database query caching, web browser caching, and operating system memory management, where accessing data from the source is expensive and we want quick access to frequently used items.

3. **What are the time complexity and space complexity requirements for an optimal LRU Cache?**
Expected: \( O(1) \) for both `get` and `put`, with \( O(capacity) \) space complexity.
   - An optimal LRU Cache has a time complexity of O(1) for both get and put operations, achieved using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list. The space complexity is O(capacity), where capacity is the maximum number of items the cache can hold.

## Design Questions
4. **How would you implement an LRU Cache?**
   - Discuss the combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map, emphasizing why this combination is efficient.

5. **Why is a doubly linked list used in LRU Cache implementation?**
   - Explain how it allows efficient removal and insertion of nodes.

6. **What are the alternatives to a doubly linked list for implementing an LRU Cache?**
   - Compare to alternatives like a single linked list, priority queue, or circular buffer.

7. **What happens if the cache size is 1?**
   - Discuss edge cases and how your implementation handles them.

8. **How would you handle frequent updates to the cache?**
   - Explore scenarios where `put` or `get` operations occur at high frequency and discuss the potential bottlenecks.

## Code Analysis
9. **Walk me through the code for your LRU Cache implementation.**
   - Explain each function (`get`, `put`, `remove`, `insert`) and the role of sentinel nodes if used.

10. **What are the potential pitfalls in your implementation?**
    - Discuss issues like memory leaks, incorrect pointer management, or edge cases.

11. **How would you test your LRU Cache implementation?**
    - Suggest test cases:
      - Basic functionality (e.g., adding and accessing keys).
      - Evicting the least recently used item.
      - Handling duplicate `put` calls.
      - Handling edge cases like capacity = 0 or 1.

12. **How does your implementation handle concurrent access?**
    - Discuss thread safety and what changes would be needed for a multithreaded environment.

## Optimization and Trade-offs
13. **How would you optimize your implementation for very large capacity?**
    - Discuss memory overhead and whether additional optimizations are needed for a very high number of entries.

14. **What trade-offs are involved in your design?**
    - Compare time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity.

15. **Could you modify your design to allow customization, such as replacing LRU with LFU (Least Frequently Used)?**
    - Discuss the flexibility of the current design and what changes would be required.

## Behavioral and Problem-solving
16. **What challenges did you face while implementing an LRU Cache?**
    - Share a specific problem you encountered and how you solved it.

17. **If you encountered a bug in your implementation during testing, how would you debug it?**
    - Discuss debugging strategies for pointer errors or hash map issues.

18. **How would you handle capacity resizing for an LRU Cache (e.g., increasing or decreasing the capacity dynamically)?**
    - Explore design changes to accommodate dynamic resizing.

---

## Advanced Variants
19. **How would you implement an LRU Cache in a distributed system?**
    - Discuss how to handle consistency, replication, and eviction policies across nodes.

20. **How can you make an LRU Cache persistent (e.g., saving its state to disk)?**
    - Explore serialization or using a database for persistent storage.

21. **What happens if the hash map implementation has a lot of hash collisions?**
    - Analyze the performance impact and discuss how to mitigate it.

22. **Can you design an LRU Cache where `get` is \( O(1) \) but `put` is \( O(\log N) \)?**
    - Propose alternatives like using a binary search tree or a priority queue for the eviction policy.

## Hands-on Coding Challenges
23. **Write code to extend the LRU Cache to store additional metadata with each entry.**
    - Example: Add a timestamp for each entry or track how many times a key has been accessed.

24. **Modify your LRU Cache to return the most frequently accessed item in \( O(1) \).**
    - Combine LRU and LFU policies and handle corner cases.

25. **Implement a simpler version of an LRU Cache using just an array or linked list.**
    - Discuss the inefficiencies and compare with the doubly linked list + hash map approach.
