# Interview Questions Based on Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## 1. Explain the Recursive Approach

**Question:** How does the recursive approach in the `serialize` and `deserialize` methods work? Can you explain the logic behind how the tree is traversed and reconstructed?

**Answer:**
- In the `serialize` method, the tree is traversed using preorder traversal (root, left, right). For each node:
  - If the node is `null`, "null" is added to the result list.
  - Otherwise, the node's value is added, and the left and right subtrees are recursively processed.
- In the `deserialize` method, the serialized string is split into a list of node values. A helper function uses recursion to construct the tree:
  - If the current value is "null", it returns `None` and moves to the next value.
  - Otherwise, it creates a new `TreeNode` with the current value, then recursively constructs the left and right children.

## 2. Time and Space Complexity

**Question:** What are the time and space complexities of the `serialize` and `deserialize` functions? How would these complexities change if the tree were a skewed binary tree (all nodes only on one side)?

**Answer:**
- **Time Complexity:**
  - `serialize`: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.
  - `deserialize`: O(N), as each node is processed once during reconstruction.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - Both methods use O(N) space to store the serialized data or the recursion stack in the worst case.
- In a skewed tree (e.g., all nodes only have a left child), the recursion stack depth will be O(N), which is the same as for a balanced tree, but the constant factor might be higher.

## 3. Null Value Handling

**Question:** Why do we use "null" to represent empty nodes in the serialization, and how does this help in reconstructing the tree during deserialization?

**Answer:**
- "null" represents missing child nodes, ensuring that the serialized string preserves the tree's structure.
- Without "null", it would be ambiguous whether a missing value corresponds to a left or right child.
- During deserialization, the presence of "null" ensures that the recursive function knows when to terminate and return `None` for missing children.

## 4. Alternative Representations

**Question:** Could you propose an alternative way to represent the tree during serialization, such as using an iterative approach or a different traversal order (inorder, level order)? What are the pros and cons of these alternatives?

**Answer:**
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  - Use level-order traversal (BFS) for serialization.
  - Use an iterative approach with an explicit stack or queue instead of recursion.
- **Pros:**
  - Level-order traversal is more intuitive for representing tree structures, especially when reconstructing from a string.
  - Iterative approaches avoid recursion stack overflow for deep trees.
- **Cons:**
  - Level-order traversal may result in larger serialized strings due to extra "null" values.
  - Iterative implementations can be more complex and less elegant than recursive ones.

## 5. Modifications for N-ary Trees

**Question:** How would you modify the `Codec` class to handle N-ary trees (trees where nodes can have more than two children)? What challenges would you face, and how would you address them?

**Answer:**
- **Modification:**
  - Instead of using a fixed order (preorder), include the number of children for each node in the serialized string.
  - During deserialization, read the child count and recursively construct the subtrees.
- **Challenges:**
  - The serialized string becomes more complex, requiring additional markers for child counts.
  - Reconstruction requires careful parsing of child counts and ensuring the order is maintained.
- **Solution:**
  - Use a delimiter to separate the child count from node values.
  - Design helper functions to process the child count and recursively build the tree structure.
